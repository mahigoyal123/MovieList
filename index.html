            Few lives in our times are as dramatic and enigmatic as the saga of Sanjay Dutt. 
            Coming from a family of cinema legends, he himself became a film star, and then 
            saw dizzying heights and darkest depths: adulation of die-hard fans, unending battles
             with various addictions, brushes with the underworld, prison terms, loss of loved ones,
              and the haunting speculation that he might or might not be a terrorist. Sanju is in turns a hilarious and heartbreaking exploration of one man's battle against his own wild self and the formidable external forces trying to crush him. It depicts the journey of a man through everything that life can throw at him. Some true stories leave you thinking "did this really happen?" 
            This is one such unbelievable story that happens to be true.
